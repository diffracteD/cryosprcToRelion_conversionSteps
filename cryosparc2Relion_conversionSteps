micrograph path:
/media/nfsraid01/Data/user/K4/SLAC_Q4_apo_20201116/aligned/motioncor2/1.2.3


Path of .mrcs links corresponding to particle coordinates from CS:
/media/nfsraid01/Processed/user/k4/relion/conversionFromCS/CSextract




1. Python3 /usr/local/pyem/csparc2star.py particleFile.cs passthroughFIle.cs desiredName.star --micrograph-path /media/nfsraid01/Data/user/K4/SLAC_Q4_Ca4_20201116/aligned/motioncor2/1.2.3/ --swapxy --boxsize 300

2. sed -i 's/_particles.mrc/_particles.mrcs/g' J136.star
3. ln -s <directory where picked particles from CS in .mrc format> .

4.
#Rename all .mrc as .mrcs
nano rename.sh

Step1: Create a shell script rename.sh under current directory with the following code:
--------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

for file in $(find . -name "*$1"); do
  mv "$file" "${file%$1}$2"
done
-------------------------------------
Step2: Run it by ./rename.sh .old .new

Eg. ./rename.sh .html .txt

5. Open the .star file and replace .mrcs file path with new absolute path (of the .mrcs links created).
    If the particle file is too big then gedit won’t work. Use the following command:
    sed -i ‘s@J387/extract/@/sdf/group/cryoem/g/CT23/caV/particle/@g’ filename.star

    (normal sed command has been replaced ‘/’ with ‘@’, because string that needed change has / character in it)

6. Edit final STAR file and include _rlnImageSize #col_number  (enter boxSize in the ‘number’ column).
7. Similarly enter _rlnImageDimensionality" (should be 2 for SPA), if not present already.

8. Check _rlnRandomSubset values: if all are 1 or 2 then delete the column and column identifier in the star file (this is a bug in the conversion program, if not done refinement will fail).
